## How To Run Locally:

To run this application locally, first clone the repository to your local machine. Next, run 'npm install' from the root directory, the app directory as well as the /backend directory. Finally, create a virtual python environment within the same /backend directory and install the python depencies (via the 'pip install -r requirements.txt' command.). Now the application should be via running 'python main.py' from the backend directory! This willl require a SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI, a SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS flag and a SECRET_KEY.
